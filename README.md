</details>
<details>
    <summary>
        Does this boilerplate support internationalization (i18n) for multi-language support ?
    </summary>
    For the moment, no. But it might come with some time.
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
        How can I implement a cooldown system for commands ?
    </summary>
    You don't need to do it, one small and basic exist already. You might want to tae a look at the "example.js" in the "Commands" folder
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
        Why most of the features for commands are not available in /commands ?(Cooldown, status, etc..)
    </summary>
    I got very lazy but feel free to open a PR if you want to add them it should be easy you have the example already(even if it's not perfect) :)
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
        Is there support for automatic command reloading or hot-reloading ?
    </summary>
    Yup, you can use the "reload" command for it ! (It will clear the console too if you don't modify the code)
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
        How can I implement a system for handling user input prompts or interactive dialogs ?
    </summary>
    You can take a look at this command(prefix: https://github.com/TheHellTower/Discord-Bot-List/blob/master/src/Commands/Administration/Prefix.js ) to get a example using dialog and button !
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
        Will you add more features than the planned list later ?
    </summary>
    No, this will only be a boilerplate. However, I will use it for open-source bots that will, have different features ! So feel free to follow me to be notified when a bot get published !
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
        Did you already planned a open-source bot to make with this boilerplate ?
    </summary>
    Yes, maybe I should not say it that "loudly" as the code isn't really clean or well structured there for the moment, but I plan to remake the popular WatchBot !

    Note: I have no intention on breaking or harm their business so I will not include any payment system for the dashboard and directly add the VIP features(also take in note that I will not remake ALL their features for obvious reasons, I said I have no intention on breakinr or harm their business).
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
        Can you really remake ANY bot ?
    </summary>
    Yes and no, it fully depend on you, if you have unrealistic dead-lines for example it will be impossible to achieve your goal.. but yeah otherwise if you are someone realistic it's possible to remake mostly any bot (not ALL due to some obvious reasons, private API usages for official game bots, etc..) !
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
        Do you plan to make the futur bots ONLY in JS or TS ?
    </summary>
    Yes and no, it would depend on a poll, I planned to open a Discord server for polls, etc.. about future open-source repositories(bots, etc..) (or even closed-source projects), it mean you would be able to propose bots to remake + their language(either JS or TS or Both)
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
        I have a permmissions problem, what to do ?
    </summary>
    Well yeah I used the oldly used "Bitwise Permission Flags", I'm not sure if it fork in the template right now as I did all my tests in a guild I own. In the worst case you still can take a look at this: https://discord-api-types.dev/api/discord-api-types-payloads/common#PermissionFlagsBits to get supported flags version :)
</details>
<details>
    <summary>
        Will you do a cleanup on this code ?
    </summary>
    Well, good question.. I'm not sure yet as I might just use it for futur open-source bot and cleanup in their respective repository. But it should be done if I get enough motivation.

    - 50â‚¬) "Support the first month*"

    Note: The support is only for this code base, if you haven't altered the structure too much(Code cleanup doesn't count as too much altered), no other code in your bot such as a command you added.
    *) Include code support even for commands you added.
